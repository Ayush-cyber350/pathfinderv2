### SHORTEST PATH VISUALISER
HI,
WELCOME TO SHORTEST PATH VISUALISER! I built this web application using react and my algorithm knowledge as I wanted to make something fun and fascinating
using what I have learnt while doing DSA. This Application uses DIJKSTRA'S Algoritm to find shortest path between two nodes also you can build walls in between
node to check how it affects the shortest path. 
You can read more about application in tutorial below.

### Tutorial
Application uses Dijkstra's algoritm. Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later.

You can move starting node in green using click of mouse and droping in desired empty node same for end node in red i.e end node.

A wall is kind of road blocker in path so we cannot pass through it and algoritm have to find different path.


You can build wall by clicking and holding mouse on empty nodes of grid.
